The lack of a versatile, accessible, and easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific solutions in robotic manipulation—and in many cases, to force-unaware, sensorless approaches

The sensor is constructed from tiled, parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor’s geometry and its mechanical response.


1. Customizable & Versatile:

eFlesh can be adapted to any robot form — from fingertips to footpads — using a modular, 3D-printable sensor structure.

Design is based on convex 3D shapes (STL/OBJ files) that can be converted into touch sensors using open-source software.


2. Low-Cost Fabrication:

Uses accessible materials like:

Hobbyist 3D printer

Off-the-shelf magnets (< $5)

Simple magnetometer circuit board

Easy to build and scale without requiring specialized equipment.


3. Magnetic Touch Sensing:

Senses force through magnetic field changes, detected by a Hall effect/magnetometer sensor.

Deformation of the printed microstructure changes the magnetic flux density, which is used to sense touch and force.

4. Cut-Cell Microstructure Design:

Printed with parameterized internal structures to tune the geometry and mechanical sensitivity.

Allows designers to control how soft or stiff the sensor is


5. Accurate & Efficient:

Contact localization RMSE: 0.5 mm

Force prediction RMSE: 0.27 N (normal) and 0.12 N (shear)

Slip detection generalizes to unseen objects with 95% accuracy

Achieves 91% success in tasks requiring sub-mm precision






Applications of eFlesh:



1. Robotic Manipulation:
   

Enhances grip precision and force control in robotic hands, arms, and grippers.
